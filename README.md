The following pipeline documents the process of re-assembling the thimbleberry (*Rubus parviflorus) genome starting with the SRAs from NCBI and ending with an annotated genome.

It follows the process outlined by [Yi et. al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04097-z) while modifying scripts from [Kaede H.](https://github.com/kaede0e/stinging_nettle_genome_assembly/blob/main/1_genome_assembly_with_PBHiFi_HiC/how_to_run_this_assembly_workflow.md) and [Eric G.](https://github.com/ericgonzalezs/ASSEMBLIES/tree/main).
